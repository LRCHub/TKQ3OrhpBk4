[00:06.98] Well I ain't afraid of dying, it's the thought of being dead
[00:13.26] I wanna go on being me once my eulogy's been read
[00:20.12] Don't spread my ashes out to sea, don't lay me down to rest
[00:27.17] You can put my mind at ease if you fill my last request
[00:54.67] 
[00:35.03] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[00:42.16] Lord I wanna go to Heaven, but I don't wanna go tonight
[00:49.30] Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand
[00:57.17] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[01:16.17] 
[01:04.54] Just let my headstone be a neon sign
[01:11.16] Just let it burn in memory of all of my good times
[01:18.56] Fix me up with a mannequin, just remember I like blondes
[01:24.81] I'll be the life of the party even when I'm dead and gone
[01:53.31] 
[01:31.39] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[01:38.53] Lord I wanna go to Heaven, but I don't wanna go tonight
[01:45.72] Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand
[01:53.67] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[02:12.67] 
[02:14.92] Just make your next selection
[02:17.93] And while your still in line
[02:21.74] You can pay your last respects
[02:24.73] One quarter at a time
[02:35.23] 
[02:27.89] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[02:34.99] Lord I wanna go to Heaven, but I don't wanna go tonight
[02:42.09] Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand
[02:50.06] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[03:09.06] 
[02:56.86] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[03:04.03] Lord I wanna go to Heaven, but I don't wanna go tonight
[03:11.24] Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand
[03:19.14] Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
[03:25.52] Lord prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
